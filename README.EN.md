# Crackmes-Repository

Open repository for crackmes and reverse engineering.

### Disclaimer by Reversing.ID

Untuk versi Bahasa Indonesia, lihat [README.md](README.md).

This repository is created to collect and preserve crackmes for educational purpose in reverse engineering field. Anyone can access this repository, either you are member of `Reversing.ID` community or not, this repository is always open.

This inisiative comes from the case of "the down of crackmes.de" where their server is seized and more than thousands crackmes vanished. The panic (for many times) engulf the community but then some people has offer mirrors of it. This initiative is purely for learning Reversing Engineering purpose. `Reversing.ID`, with this repository, won't encourage any illegal activity and any use misuse of this repository is not our responsibility.

In our internal, we want a nice place that can be used to refer crackmes without worrying that the place would vanish. A place for our reference. Therefore we not only preserve crackmes.de files, but also crackmes from various sources. We hope that they are not vanished but when they are, we hope our contribution can be used for the reversing community.

### What is Crackme?

Crackme is a small program designed as an object of reverse engineering. Crackme is created by other reverser as a legal way to learn software cracking, since no IP (Intellectual Property) there. Crackme has range of difficulty level, one can be very easy and other can be very hard, depends on the protection. The crackme that feel like real-world challenge use algorithm that usually implemented in commercial software.

Crackme can be divided as several categories, based on characteristics or goal for beat the challenge.
- CrackMe
  Defeat or eliminate the protection of program so it can run smoothly without limitation (trial).
- KeygenMe
  Create a program for generating valid serial number that is acceptable by program.
- UnpackMe
  Do unpacking to main module of program which is compressed or encrypted by certain methods.  

### How to Download?

For now you can clone the repository or download the crackme manually. Next time, we will create a download system which can be accessed by a script to ease this process.

### How to Contribute?

This is an open project.

You can share crackmes you have or you know if it's not in our list yet. To do it, your options are:

- Do a pull request
- Send mail to `pengurus [at] reversing.id`
- Notify us at telegram group `@ReversingID`

You can also help us by host all the crackmes so anyone can download it directly. Tell us your server and we will add it as mirror list.

You can also review and write solution / writeup to any crackmes. For this purpose, go to [Solution](https://github.com/ReversingID/Crackmes-Solution) and give us your pull request.


So, happy cracking.
