The FBI has intercepted a program which contains important information. The program needs a code to give the information free, but the FBI and CIA are clueless and has asked you, as a professional cracker, to get the information from the program.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;b&gt;The Story of the FBI:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
A Russian maffia group who call them selfs Brevihock are planning an attack on the american ambasy in Berlin (Germany). Atleast that is what the cought suspect says. He says it has something to do with a recently researched technology in a Russian laboratory about radio-active radiation. This is all the suspect swears to know. He does not know when the attack is going to take place. The Russian goverment is clueless too because all of the research institutes have to report their foundings to the goverment. Nothing of this has been reported and the Russian police is drowning in the loads of paperwork to go through, seeing if they can find any of this back in the research documents taken from the laboratories.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
The FBI can not get their hands on the documents because Russia wont cooperate. The FBI has managed to crack the email of the suspect though. This resulted in some information about corrupted professors ont he payroll in Russia and the role of the suspect in this case. The suspect needed to provide some goods to the laboratory so they can finish the weapon.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
In one of the emails there was an applications (windows based) which should contain the exact location of the laboratie. The applications needs somekind of code. How hard the FBI tries, the suspect claims to have forgotten the code.... We know that is not the truth but mor he wont spit.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;b&gt;Assignment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
Crack the application and find the exact location!<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
** Tested on Windows Xp and Vista **&lt;br&gt;<br />
Mail me if you have problems, want tips!&lt;br&gt;<br />
Also mail me if have managed to get the location.&lt;br&gt;<br />
If you have found the location and looked it up, you will know if it is right or not.</p><p>

Can not wait for a solution for it either. There really is no infinite loop that I know of... You could have created it by yourself, a little piece of the program is self modifying.<br />

No the location is not &quot;)&quot; without quotes.

It happens because it keeps checking if AL == CC and it does...<br />
It seems we have to put some opcodes in the crackme (wich are also used in the algo =) ), but i have no idea wich ones.<br />

You have found one of the secutiy checkpoints.... Now you have to deal with it ;) and I am not going to spoil the idea of the loop you just mentioned. Goodluck<br />

There are no rules to crack this one. Patch all you want and even bruteforce the app if you want...

I said GUESS because I don't think there is a way out in the crackme by deduction. As it to bruteforce(it is just another way to guess) and patch, I can not find an aesthetic way for it either:(</td></tr><tr><th><strong><a title="View profile for red477" href="/users/red477">red477</a></strong><br />13.

Nov 2007</th><td>Here are some clues:<br />
1. I have used 2 ways to execute functions, just to confuse the cracker. <br />
2. The bytes created on runtime, and written near the Entry Point are based on a very small algo which uses your security code. Check out the second way the program executes functions, that should help.<br />
3. The way you have to put in the security code is quiete easy. once you have found out how, you must known that OllyDbg has a little issue with the returned data of the function that reads the security code.(maybe other debuggers to, but that I dont know). It was quiete a struggle for me to code it, by accident it has become an anti-debugging option, but it was not the purpose. You can check this problem out quiete easy. Tip: Once you have the correct password and execute the program in the debugger, it still will raise an exception error, or a &quot;Don't send&quot; error in Windows.<br />
4. Patching is not always an option since the &quot;location message&quot; is based on bytes in the program. You really must know what to patch... (see hint 3).<br />
<br />
Is this better ;) ?<br />
<br />
Hopefully,<br />

There is one &quot;bug&quot;/ design problem&quot;.<br />
DONT RENAME THE PROGRAMM. (If you check out why then this is an additional hint for hint 3 in the previous message)<br />
<br />
Another hint:<br />
the story is about an EXACT location.. It would be logical if this location was in a universal format so everybody could look it up easily... ;)<br />
<br />
This one is supposed to be hard, but I did not know how hard it is for experienced reversers to finish this one.<br />
I have spend approx. 40-50 hours on creating the idea, programming and testing the app.</td></tr><tr class="even"><th><strong><a title="View profile for Zaphod" href="/users/zaphod">Zaphod</a></strong><br />13. Nov 2007</th><td>I just don't get it!<br />
<br />
At some point I come to this line:  <br />
mov dl, byte ptr ss:[ecx+eax]<br />
<br />
At this moment ecx = 0, eax = 401067<br />
<br />
Then I would expect dl to get the value of byte ptr[ecx+eax], that is, byte ptr[401067] after execution of the command.<br />
<br />
A few lines above I can see that the content of 401067 is 90h ( nop )<br />
<br />
Never the less dl = CC when that line is executed. How is that possible? what IS it with that ss before [ecx+eax]?<br />
<br />

Nov 2007</th><td>To merker:<br />
This is not the way to deal with it.... You could try though. But it is about an exact location... Not like there is any readable understandable message you could guess. If you have created readables matches a 0 could also be a 12,3,4, or 5 or a B could easily be a C or D.<br />
<br />
To Zaphod:<br />
You should first discover what CC is about. And Why is 401067 90h (NOP), probably because you patched the code. Patching is tricky with this crackme though... The location is based on bytes in the program. So if you patch a wrong byte which is needed for the location then you still have no solution.<br />

<br />
Just to be absolutely sure I downloaded a new and fresh version of crack3, loaded it in Olly and started stepping F8. When I arrived at &quot;0040102D JGE SHORT crack3.00401047&quot; I changed the sign flag from 1 to 0 to make sure the jump was taken.<br />
<br />
Pressed F8 to jump, changed the sign flag back to 1 just to be absolutely safe - and went on stepping F8. When I got to &quot;00401062 CALL crack3.0040121C&quot; I tried executing this call in two different ways:<br />
<br />
1. F8 to step over the call. This resulted in an exception.<br />
<br />
2. F7 to step into the call. Then ctrl-F7 to animate through most of the loop ( 155h bytes ). Stopped with F12 when the loop was almost done and finished manually. This way the call was executed without exceptions.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how this can be! Help :)</td></tr><tr class="even"><th><strong><a title="View profile for __imp__" href="/users/imp">__imp__</a></strong><br />14.

When the loop hits the return, it goes back where it got called from (after the call) wich leads to some algo to modify the code...<br />

yep thats true<br />

i just wrote a bruter for the range of 00h to 7Ah<br />

There is 1000ms of Sleep in the program. What did you do with it when you bruteforced the program?

@devoney ASCII and ANSI charcode u can find here<br />
http://www.torsten-horn.de/techdocs/ascii.htm<br />
its likely www.asciitable.com<br />
if the final produkt only has chars from 00h till 7F it can be bruted</td></tr><tr class="colored"><th><strong><a title="View profile for Devoney" href="/users/devoney">Devoney</a></strong><br /><u>Author</u><br />20.

A-Z? also included or only small ones<br />

i wrote a bruteforcer that test for all possible combination from 30-7A + one 2D<br />

when i will run that bruter i will get all possible security codes in that range and that will be much<br />
<br />
also with the limitation of one 2D<br />

will push my 2x2.400 cores some days to get only all possible security code<br />
